Checklist items should be in the form - [ ] {item}. When they are in progress, you should mark them as [PROGRESS] {item}. When they are finished, they should be marked [x] {item}.

Warnings should be put at the bottom of the checklist, and should include anything that you feel may impede our progress.

If I say I am unsure about a decision when I ask you for questions, please put a task for making the decision under a "Considerations" section at the top of the page.

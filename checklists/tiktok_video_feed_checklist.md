# TikTok-like Video Feed Implementation Checklist

## Considerations
- [x] Decide on the video display order: ascending (oldest first) vs. descending (newest first).  
  *Typically, newer videos are shown first for a TikTok-like experience, but confirm based on UX requirements.*

## Tasks
- [x] **Firestore Setup:**  
  - [x] Create (or verify) a Firestore collection named `videos` to store video metadata.
    - [x] Define necessary fields such as `url`, `timestamp`, `title` (optional), etc.
- [x] **Video Upload Process Update:**  
  - [x] Update the video upload service to store metadata.
    - [x] After uploading the video to Firebase Storage, add its download URL and metadata (including the timestamp) to the Firestore `videos` collection.
- [x] **Flutter UI Implementation:**  
  - [x] Create a new screen/widget (e.g., `VideoFeedScreen`) to display the video feed.
  - [x] Integrate a Firestore query:
    - [x] Fetch documents from the `videos` collection, ordered by the timestamp field (choose ascending or descending based on the decision above).
  - [x] Design a scrolling list:
    - [x] Use a `ListView` (or a similar widget) to display each video entry.
  - [x] Video Playback:
    - [x] Integrate the `video_player` plugin for rendering each video.
    - [x] Set up play/pause behavior as needed (consider auto-play/pause when videos enter/exit the viewport).
- [ ] **Testing:**  
  - [ ] Test video feed functionality on both mobile and web platforms.
  - [ ] Validate that the video queries, playback, and performance meet requirements.

## Warnings
- [ ] Ensure proper Firestore indexing on the `timestamp` field for efficient querying.
- [ ] Monitor resource usage and network consumption, as video streaming and playback can be intensive.
- [ ] Confirm cross-platform compatibility for video playback in varying network conditions.

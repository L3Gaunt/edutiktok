# Detailed Checklist for Mediasoup Server Setup with Buffering, Dynamic Rerouting, and Firebase Auth Integration

## Considerations
- [ ] Decide on the recommendation system's architecture and algorithm (e.g., rules-based vs. machine learning approach).
- [ ] Define the maximum in-memory buffer size/duration and eviction strategy to prevent RAM overflow. <- maximal duration of one utterance: 15 seconds, max total buffer size: 1 GB
- [ ] Evaluate how to handle partial utterance streaming (e.g., starting playback while the speaker is still talking vs. waiting for a complete segment). <- start playing back from bufferas soon as speaker starts talking
- [ ] Determine the signaling strategy and whether any custom protocols are needed for real-time dynamic switching.
- [ ] Clarify role-based permissions for producers vs. consumers and any additional security considerations.

## Checklist

### Project Setup
- [ ] **Initialize the Project**
  - [ ] Run `npm init -y` (if not already done).
  - [ ] Install mediasoup and necessary dependencies:
    - [ ] `npm install mediasoup@3`
    - [ ] Install additional libraries as needed (e.g., Express, Firebase Admin SDK).

### Mediasoup Server Basic Setup
- [ ] **Create Mediasoup Workers and Routers**
  - [ ] Set up one or more mediasoup workers using `mediasoup.createWorker()`.
  - [ ] For each worker, create one or more routers for handling different "rooms" or conferences.
- [ ] **Setup WebRTC Transports**
  - [ ] Create send transports (for broadcasters/speakers) using `router.createWebRtcTransport()`.
  - [ ] Create receive transports (for viewers) similarly.
- [ ] **Implement the Signaling Layer**
  - [ ] Develop endpoints to manage connection establishment.
  - [ ] Handle events such as "connect", "produce", and "consume" for proper coordination between clients and the server.

### Media Production and Consumption
- [ ] **Implement Media Production**
  - [ ] Establish producers on the server using `transport.produce()` when a client sends media.
- [ ] **Implement Media Consumption**
  - [ ] Establish consumers on the server using `transport.consume()` so that viewers can receive streams.

### Buffering Module
- [ ] **Design and Implement an In-Memory Buffer**
  - [ ] Create a data structure to record each new utterance/video clip.
  - [ ] Continuously record incoming media chunks into this buffer.
- [ ] **Manage Buffer Size**
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage of the buffer.
  - [ ] Implement an eviction strategy to remove old utterances and prevent RAM overflow.
- [ ] **Testing the Buffer**
  - [ ] Test buffer performance under simulated high-load conditions.

### Recommendation System Integration
- [ ] **Develop and Integrate Recommendation Logic**
  - [ ] Create a module that analyzes buffered media based on user preferences, context, or other criteria.
  - [ ] Develop an API/function to decide which utterance should be played back for each viewer.
  - [ ] Integrate this recommendation mechanism with the dynamic rerouting of streams.

### Dynamic Rerouting / Partial Streaming
- [ ] **Implement Dynamic Rerouting**
  - [ ] Enable starting playback on a partially received utterance.
  - [ ] Dynamically route or remap media producers to consumers based on real-time recommendations.
- [ ] **Error Handling and Synchronization**
  - [ ] Ensure robust error handling to manage mid-utterance switching.
  - [ ] Synchronize streams properly to avoid latency or jitter issues.

### Testing and Optimization
- [ ] **Unit and End-to-End Testing**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for each module (mediasoup setup, buffering, recommendation, and rerouting).
  - [ ] Perform end-to-end tests simulating multiple peers.
- [ ] **Performance Profiling and Optimization**
  - [ ] Profile buffering and dynamic rerouting logic to minimize latency.
  - [ ] Optimize the recommendation system to ensure real-time performance.
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**
  - [ ] Implement extensive logging for mediasoup events.
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage, transport states, and media routing events.

### Deployment Preparations
- [ ] **Deployment and Scalability**
  - [ ] Prepare deployment scripts or container definitions (e.g., Docker) for scaling the server.
  - [ ] Set up overall system logging and performance monitoring.
- [ ] **Security Configurations**
  - [ ] Ensure the signaling channel and all endpoints are served over HTTPS/WSS.

### User Authentication / Authorization (Firebase Auth Integration)
- [ ] **Integrate Firebase Auth for User Authentication**
  - [ ] Implement client-side Firebase login to obtain the Firebase ID token.
- [ ] **Set Up Firebase Admin SDK on the Backend**
  - [ ] Install Firebase Admin: `npm install firebase-admin`
  - [ ] Initialize Firebase Admin with your service account credentials.
- [ ] **Implement Firebase Authentication Middleware**
  - [ ] Develop middleware to verify Firebase ID tokens from the `Authorization` header.
  - [ ] Map authenticated user data (and any custom claims) to mediasoup operations (e.g., tagging producers/consumers with user IDs).
- [ ] **Secure the Signaling Channel**
  - [ ] Enforce HTTPS/WSS throughout the signaling process.
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control**
  - [ ] Use Firebase custom claims to manage and enforce roles (e.g., distinguishing between producers and consumers).

## Warnings
- [ ] High memory usage can occur if in-memory buffer management is not tightly controlled; implement strict limits and a robust eviction policy.
- [ ] Dynamic rerouting of streams introduces synchronization challenges that could lead to latency issues.
- [ ] The real-time recommendation system might add significant computational overheadâ€”ensure its performance is optimized.
- [ ] Always secure tokens and sensitive data by enforcing HTTPS/WSS in all client-server communications.
- [ ] Keep Firebase service account credentials secure and restrict access appropriately.
